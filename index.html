                <p>
                    There's nothing to brag about myself. Just trying to be a developer at my own. It's been a tough time as I gotta perform other responsibilities as well but I'm trying my best to give time in this and carry on for future.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="c">
                <h3 class="h">motivate thyself</h3>
                <p>The manager was once a Cashier. The owner was once an Employee. The master was once a Student. The head chief was once a Trainee. The superstar was once a Nobody. None starts at top, we all gotta try and reach there.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="c">
                <h3 class="h">go for it</h3>
                <p>
                    Don't just dream, do something that will help you to achieve your dream. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too. So, let's have a good vibe around and try as much as we can.</p>
